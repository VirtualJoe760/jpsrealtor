# Campaign UI - Implementation Summary

## What I Built

I've created a **modern, industry-leading campaign management UI** for your agent dashboard, inspired by best practices from HubSpot, Mailchimp, Linear, and Notion.

---

## 🎨 UI Pattern: Card Grid + Side Panel

### Why This Pattern?

After analyzing major SaaS companies (HubSpot, Mailchimp, Linear, Salesforce), I chose a **hybrid approach**:

1. **Main View:** Card grid layout (visual, scannable)
2. **Detail View:** Slide-out side panel (non-disruptive, keeps context)
3. **Full Page:** Option to "pop out" for deep work

### Better Than Accordion Because:
- **Accordions are limiting** - hard to show rich content (charts, tables, tabs)
- **Side panels keep context** - agents can see campaign list while viewing details
- **Non-modal** - doesn't block the screen like a modal
- **Modern UX** - matches Linear, Notion, Slack (industry leaders)
