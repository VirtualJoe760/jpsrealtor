This 13.3 acres is located in the desirable Morro Hills area of Fallbrook.  This area of Fallbrook gets consistent cooling ocean breezes making it an ideal climate to live and work in.  The spacious home is situated on the knoll of the property to capture views all around.  You can even see the ocean on a clear day!  The sunsets are astounding from this property.  Currently the farm is being used as a working horse ranch but was once a producing avocado grove.  There is plenty of open space to develop into your hearts desire.  You may add an ADU and even a junior ADU with county permission to add extra living space in another part of the property.  The climate and topography would be great to further expand this into an elite equestrian farm, have a small vineyard, grow coffee, grow really any kind of fruit or vegetables.  Make it your hobby farm or family compound.  The farm is situated on the south side of Fallbrook abutting Oceanside. You are just minutes to both the Bonsall and Fallbrook villages.  The home and property is currently serviced by city water but there are two well heads on the land.  There is a small oak Gove and mature coral trees on the farm.  There are two separate gated entrances which make running as an equestrian farm or developing additional housing fluid and simply.  The property is entirely fenced. If you are an avid equestrian the 175x225 riding arena features premium footing!  The owner went to great expense to keep our equestrian friends comfortable when being ridden.  The animal designator code for this farm allows for lots of horses. Going inside to human creature comforts the home offers astounding views, newer windows with a lifetime warranty, hardy cement fire resistant siding on the entire home, all new copper plumbing, new wiring and electrical boxes and solid alder wood doors.  There is a downstairs granny flat with a kitchenette. The current owners also added a new water main from the street as well as upgraded the septic tank and leach field.  The home and barn area is currently serviced by a 2 inch meter but can easily be changed over to 4 1 inch meters.
