This rare listing is an awesome opportunity that features a fenced acre of land with spectacular views, a well, and electricity onsite.  Best of all, you can buy the lot and construct your home with NO DOWN PAYMENT and no special qualifying criteria.\r\n\r\nIt is located only a short 25-minute drive up the hill from downtown Palm Desert.  You will be impressed with the abundant indigenous landscaping which includes rare native pinyon pine trees, manzanita bushes and other plants that will bloom colors in the springtime.\r\n\r\nThis property is an idyllic retreat for those seeking peace and proximity with nearby modern amenities.  There are spectacular mountain views and amazing sunsets with an average temperature about 20 degrees cooler than the Coachella Valley.\r\n\r\nSnow falls a few times during winter which provides stunning snowscapes. For utilities, Anza Electric is a non-profit co-op which means your electricity cost is about half of what Edison charges.  High-speed internet is also available for a very modest price.\r\n\r\nFor an extra $14,500, you can purchase a 33-foot Eclipse Recreational travel trailer in excellent condition.  The travel trailer provides a comfortable place to stay or use as a base while building your dream home or recreational setup.\r\n\r\nCall me for a tour or more details!","resourceUri":"/v1/listings/20250606232644776963000000","roadFrontageType":"County Road","seniorCommunityYN":false,"sewer":"Unknown","slug":"20250606232644776963000000","slugAddress":"63330-jeraboa-road-mountain-center-ca-92561","sourceSystemID":"M00000072","sourceSystemKey":"20250606232644776963000000","sourceSystemName":"Greater Palm Springs Multiple Listing Service","spaYN":false,"sparkModificationTimestamp":"2025-06-06T23:56:15Z","specialListingConditions":"Standard","standardStatus":"Active","stateOrProvince":"CA","statusChangeDate":"2025-06-06","statusChangeTimestamp":"2025-06-06T23:47:01Z","streetName":"Jeraboa","streetNumber":"63330","streetNumberInteger":63330,"streetSuffix":"Road","subdivisionName":"Alpine Village/Pyn P","totalBathroomsSource":"MLS","unparsedAddress":"63330 Jeraboa Road, Mountain Center, CA 92561","unparsedFirstLineAddress":"63330 Jeraboa Road","utilities":"Electricity Available","vOWAddressDisplayYN":true,"vOWAutomatedValuationDisplayYN":true,"vOWConsumerCommentYN":true,"vOWEntireListingDisplayYN":true,"videosCount":0,"view":"Desert, Hills, Mountain(s), Panoramic, Trees/Woods, Valley","viewYN":true,"virtualToursCount":0,"waterSource":"Well","zoningDescription":"Assessor","cluster":false}},{"type":"Feature","id":18258,"properties":{"cluster":true,"cluster_id":18258,"point_count":2,"point_count_abbreviated":2},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.46786153316498,33.60099270603311]}}]
