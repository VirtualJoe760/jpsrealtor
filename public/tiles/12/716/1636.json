Located in a highly desirable neighborhood in the Fairways Canyon community, this thoughtfully upgraded home features a sought-after floor plan and stands apart with custom finishes, designer touches, and a layout that balances comfort with everyday living. From the moment you enter, hand-painted Bedrosians tile and a graceful archway frame a breathtaking view of the hills - a clear signal this isn't your typical track home.\r\nUpstairs, the primary suite offers a quiet retreat with an en suite bath and spacious walk-in closet. Two additional bedrooms, a Jack-and-Jill bath, generous loft, and a convenient laundry room make the second floor both functional and well-designed. The loft provides space to work, relax, or play, and can easily convert to an added bedroom.\r\nDownstairs, a private Gen-Suite (multi-generational home) includes a bedroom, bath, living area, kitchenette, laundry hook-ups, and access to both front and backyard, ideal for guests, extended family, or rental flexibility.\r\nThe kitchen, redesigned with Pepper and Olive Interiors, is the centerpiece of the home. Unlike many track homes with standard construction-grade cabinetry, this space features premium Medallion cabinets and a full array of luxury appliances, including a Sub-Zero refrigerator, ILVE range, Scotsman pellet ice machine, Miele dishwasher, and Vent-a-Hood. Counter-to-ceiling Moroccan tile, marble countertops and backsplash, a large apron-front sink, imported sconces and pendants, a custom-built hood, an 8-foot granite island with seating, and a hidden bar with mosaic tile backing and pocket doors complete this stunning, high-performance space.\r\nCustom beams warm the family room, while wainscoting and a handcrafted stair railing elevate the space.\r\nThe backyard offers a low-maintenance escape with succulents, palo verde, lavender, agave, and a unique raised garden bed that frames the outdoor living space. From sunrise to sunset, enjoy 180-degree mountain views and glimpses of the golf course. Whether sipping coffee on a misty morning or unwinding at dusk with the painted skies, the sound of the fountain and the natural stillness, interrupted only by birds, create a peaceful oasis.\r\n \r\nLow HOA fees include high-speed internet and access to a gym, pools, and parks. Close to groceries and freeway access, this is the kind of space that feels good to come home to.  Furniture negotiable depending on offer.","resourceUri":"/v1/listings/20250514202544094043000000","roadSurfaceType":"Paved","roof":"Composition","schoolDistrict":"Beaumont School District","securityFeatures":"Security System Owned","seniorCommunityYN":false,"sewer":"On Site","slug":"20250514202544094043000000","slugAddress":"11375-brewer-drive-beaumont-ca-92223","sourceSystemID":"M00000072","sourceSystemKey":"20250514202544094043000000","sourceSystemName":"Greater Palm Springs Multiple Listing Service","spaYN":false,"sparkModificationTimestamp":"2025-06-11T18:48:41Z","specialListingConditions":"Standard","standardStatus":"Active","stateOrProvince":"CA","statusChangeDate":"2025-05-16","statusChangeTimestamp":"2025-05-16T14:48:23Z","storiesTotal":2,"streetName":"Brewer","streetNumber":"11375","streetNumberInteger":11375,"streetSuffix":"Drive","subdivisionName":"Not Applicable","totalBathroomsSource":"Computed","unparsedAddress":"11375 Brewer Drive, Beaumont, CA 92223","unparsedFirstLineAddress":"11375 Brewer Drive","utilities":"Cable TV","vOWAddressDisplayYN":true,"vOWAutomatedValuationDisplayYN":true,"vOWConsumerCommentYN":true,"vOWEntireListingDisplayYN":true,"videosCount":0,"view":"City Lights, Golf Course, Mountain(s), Panoramic","viewYN":true,"virtualToursCount":0,"walkScore":0,"waterSource":"Water District","windowFeatures":"Blinds, Double Pane Windows, Drapes, Screens","yearBuilt":2018,"yearBuiltSource":"Assessor","cluster":false}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.989275,33.982584]},"properties":{"_id":"684c84e1b47f2da61123a184","listingId":"219130528","accessibilityFeatures":"Grab Bars in Bath(s)","additionalParcelsYN":true,"approvalStatus":true,"architecturalStyle":"Ranch","associationFee":0,"associationYN":false,"attachedGarageYN":true,"bathroomsOneQuarter":0,"bathroomsTotalDecimal":4,"bathroomsTotalInteger":5,"bathroomsTotalNotational":5,"bathsFull":1,"bathsHalf":0,"bathsThreeQuarter":4,"bathsTotal":5,"bedsTotal":3,"buildingAreaSource":"Assessor","buildingAreaTotal":3112,"carportSpaces":0,"city":"Cherry Valley","constructionMaterials":"Block","cooling":"Air Conditioning, Ceiling Fan(s), Central Air, Electric, Gas, Heat Pump","coolingYN":true,"country":"US","countyOrParish":"Riverside","crossStreet":"Byham","currentPrice":1200000,"currentPricePublic":1200000,"displayCompliance":{"view":"Summary","iDXLogo":{"type":"Text","logoUri":"Idyllwild Realty"},"iDXLogoSmall":{"type":"Text","logoUri":"IDX"}},"documentsChangeTimestamp":"2025-05-23T19:12:16Z","documentsCount":0,"doorFeatures":"Double Door Entry, Sliding Doors","electric":"220 Volts in Laundry","entryLocation":"Ground Level -
