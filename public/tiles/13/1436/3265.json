The easement combined with the street frontage of Olympic Drive provides tremendous accessibility from all directions.  Current owners have started on plans for two duplexes and an additional 14 units for a combined 18 units (allowable by the City of Big Bear Lake).  Ski slope views are attainable from some locations on the property.","resourceUri":"/v1/listings/20250509023507355864000000","roadFrontageType":"City Street","seniorCommunityYN":false,"sewer":"On Site, Public Hookup Available","slug":"20250509023507355864000000","slugAddress":"140-olympic-drive-big-bear-lake-ca-92315","sourceSystemID":"M00000072","sourceSystemKey":"20250509023507355864000000","sourceSystemName":"Greater Palm Springs Multiple Listing Service","spaYN":false,"sparkModificationTimestamp":"2025-06-06T01:40:02Z","specialListingConditions":"Standard","standardStatus":"Active","stateOrProvince":"CA","statusChangeDate":"2025-05-08","statusChangeTimestamp":"2025-05-09T02:47:19Z","streetName":"Olympic","streetNumber":"140","streetNumberInteger":140,"streetSuffix":"Drive","subdivisionName":"Not Applicable","topography":"slight slope, then level","totalBathroomsSource":"MLS","unparsedAddress":"140 Olympic Drive, Big Bear Lake, CA 92315","unparsedFirstLineAddress":"140 Olympic Drive","utilities":"Electricity Available, Natural Gas Available","vOWAddressDisplayYN":true,"vOWAutomatedValuationDisplayYN":true,"vOWConsumerCommentYN":true,"vOWEntireListingDisplayYN":true,"videosCount":0,"view":"Mountain(s), Trees/Woods","viewYN":true,"virtualToursCount":0,"zoningDescription":"Other","cluster":false}},{"type":"Feature","id":70387,"properties":{"cluster":true,"cluster_id":70387,"point_count":3,"point_count_abbreviated":3},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.88813865184785,34.24011504524751]}},{"type":"Feature","id":27763,"properties":{"cluster":true,"cluster_id":27763,"point_count":2,"point_count_abbreviated":2},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.85833483934402,34.24030425863536]}}]
