Set on an expansive, private lot, this resort-style retreat offers the perfect blend of luxury and laid-back desert living. Welcome to 4450 Moneo Ct—an exceptional opportunity to own a stunning designer home in the premier Escena Golf Course community of Palm Springs, home to the acclaimed Jack Nicklaus-designed 18-hole championship course. This 2,421 sq ft residence is more than just a home—it's a showcase of refined architecture, elevated finishes, and laid-back vacation-style living.

This home offers the perfect combination of indoor-outdoor living and entertaining, with nearly every room featuring glass sliders opening to curated outdoor spaces that feel like private retreats. The newly resurfaced black pearl Pebble Tec pool and oversized spa are surrounded by mature palms, multiple lounge areas, and an outdoor kitchen with built-in BBQ—ideal for both social gatherings and quiet evenings at home. Inside, a stacked stone fireplace anchors the open-concept great room, while the gourmet kitchen—complete with marble countertops, an oversized island, walk-in pantry, and brand-new KitchenAid appliances—delivers style, function, and ease. A custom wet bar with wine fridge and seating adds a luxe touch, and the versatile layout includes a fourth bedroom currently styled as an executive office with built-in sink and wine fridge—perfect as a creative studio, media lounge, or guest suite. The bedrooms are thoughtfully spaced apart, offering enhanced comfort and privacy throughout. The primary suite is a serene escape featuring an oversized double walk-in shower with dual showerheads, vanities, and a custom-built walk-in closet. Every space is curated with intention, style, and comfort.
