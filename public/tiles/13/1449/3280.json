renovations completed last year in this rare Hacienda II floorplan, located off the green of the 5th hole on the Jones Course. With breathtaking Panoramic Views of the Santa Rosa Mountains, located at the end of the cul-de-sac, and featuring 4 bedrooms, 4.5 bathrooms (including a renovated detached casita) the home rests on a premium lot with ample outdoor space for multiple seating areas, lush privacy amongst the citrus trees, and water features to add a relaxing calmness while enjoying the outside. The list of upgrades in this home includes: newly painted interior, new carpeting/tile flooring through the home, new vanities, new fixtures and new toilets. The side patio was fully renovated to accomodate a quaint seating area, next to high-quality shaded space with artificial grass for kids or pets to play in. The kitchen was completely re-imagined with new countertops, single-slab quartzite kitchen island, freshly painted cabinets and a new refridgerator. The formal dining room boasts a chic, custom bookcase built to compliment the oversized wine fridge wall across the table. New custom blinds along the interior and exterior of the home, as well as all new exterior lighting, round out a lengthy list of enhancements.
