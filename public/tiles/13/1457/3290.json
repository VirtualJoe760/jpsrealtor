Unlike many homes in the area, this one is on a permanent foundation and connected to sewerâ€”two huge pluses. It also has central air conditioning, which is a big upgrade over the mini-splits and wall units you'll usually find out here. Inside, you'll find hardwood floors, and outside there's a covered carport, a good-sized driveway, and a front porch that's perfect for relaxing.  Living near the Salton Sea has its own kind of magic. The pace is slower, the skies are bigger, and the sunsets are unbelievable. It's a great spot if you're into off-roading, birdwatching, stargazing, or just want to escape the city. There's a growing creative and outdoor-loving community here, and the area still offers real value whether you're looking for a full-time home, vacation spot, or a smart investment.","resourceUri":"/v1/listings/20250608204948929201000000","roof":"Shingle","seniorCommunityYN":false,"sewer":"In, Connected and Paid","slug":"20250608204948929201000000","slugAddress":"2683-salton-bay-drive-thermal-ca-92274","sourceSystemID":"M00000072","sourceSystemKey":"20250608204948929201000000","sourceSystemName":"Greater Palm Springs Multiple Listing Service","spaYN":false,"sparkModificationTimestamp":"2025-06-09T11:01:10Z","specialListingConditions":"Standard","standardStatus":"Active","stateOrProvince":"CA","statusChangeDate":"2025-06-08","statusChangeTimestamp":"2025-06-08T21:46:20Z","storiesTotal":0,"streetName":"Salton Bay","streetNumber":"2683","streetNumberInteger":2683,"streetSuffix":"Drive","subdivisionName":"Not Applicable","totalBathroomsSource":"Computed","unparsedAddress":"2683 Salton Bay Drive, Thermal, CA 92274","unparsedFirstLineAddress":"2683 Salton Bay Drive","utilities":"Sewer Connected","vOWAddressDisplayYN":true,"vOWAutomatedValuationDisplayYN":true,"vOWConsumerCommentYN":true,"vOWEntireListingDisplayYN":true,"videosCount":0,"view":"Desert, Mountain(s)","viewYN":true,"virtualToursCount":0,"walkScore":0,"windowFeatures":"Mini Blinds","yearBuilt":1985,"yearBuiltSource":"Assessor","cluster":false}}]
