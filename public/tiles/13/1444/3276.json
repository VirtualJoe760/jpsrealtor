Just to the right of the shelving is a gas fireplace. To the left is the dining area adjacent to the well-appointed kitchen. Yes, this kitchen can manage multiple people, so plan accordingly! Just to the immediate left of the shelving system is a hallway leading you to your primary bedroom and a primary bathroom that is a wonder unto itself. Two closets have built-in dresser drawers and plenty of closet hanging space. The bathroom has a walk-in shower that can easily accommodate two people. When you're all cleaned up, head back to the office/media room, and then on your left, you'll see your walk-in laundry room. Down the hallway, you will see the garage passage door on your right, and the entry to the second bathroom is on your left.\r\nLastly, further down the hall is the second bedroom.  Yes, this home has quite a bit of space, and you will not be disappointed.  The house is fenced in for privacy, and it overlooks the desert and lights in the near distance, yet far enough away to keep noise to zero. If you want a swim or tennis time, drive to the clubhouse and enjoy all those amenities. The clubhouse is an active venue, and you will find yourself welcomed. Look at this home and see how it can not be beat in the area. Four Seasons is a great community and is greeted by all.","resourceUri":"/v1/listings/20250523184938364731000000","roof":"Clay Tile","securityFeatures":"Community, Gated Community","seniorCommunityYN":true,"sewer":"In, Connected and Paid","slug":"20250523184938364731000000","slugAddress":"2574-windmill-way-palm-springs-ca-92262","sourceSystemID":"M00000072","sourceSystemKey":"20250523184938364731000000","sourceSystemName":"Greater Palm Springs Multiple Listing Service","spaYN":false,"sparkModificationTimestamp":"2025-06-06T01:37:02Z","standardStatus":"Active","stateOrProvince":"CA","statusChangeDate":"2025-05-23","statusChangeTimestamp":"2025-05-23T20:27:23Z","storiesTotal":1,"streetName":"Windmill","streetNumber":"2574","streetNumberInteger":2574,"streetSuffix":"Way","subdivisionName":"Four Seasons","tenantPays":"Cable TV, Electricity, Gas, Special Insurance, Trash Collection, Water","totalBathroomsSource":"Computed","unparsedAddress":"2574 Windmill Way, Palm Springs, CA 92262","unparsedFirstLineAddress":"2574 Windmill Way","utilities":"Cable TV","vOWAddressDisplayYN":true,"vOWAutomatedValuationDisplayYN":true,"vOWConsumerCommentYN":true,"vOWEntireListingDisplayYN":true,"videosCount":0,"view":"City, Desert, Hills, Panoramic","viewYN":true,"virtualToursCount":0,"walkScore":0,"waterSource":"Water District","windowFeatures":"Double Pane Windows, Drapes, Mini Blinds","yearBuilt":2005,"yearBuiltSource":"Assessor","cluster":false}},{"type":"Feature","id":13331,"properties":{"cluster":true,"cluster_id":13331,"point_count":10,"point_count_abbreviated":10},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.53328114748003,33.85897225980166]}},{"type":"Feature","id":20051,"properties":{"cluster":true,"cluster_id":20051,"point_count":5,"point_count_abbreviated":5},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.52615451812746,33.857973516008414]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.534711,33.86438]},"properties":{"_id":"684c84deb47f2da611239bfb","listingId":"219129683","accessibilityFeatures":"No Interior Steps","additionalParcelsYN":false,"approvalStatus":true,"architecturalStyle":"Contemporary, Mediterranean, Traditional","associationAmenities":"Tennis Courts, Banquet Facilities, Barbecue, Billiard Room, Bocce Ball Court, Card Room, Clubhouse, Controlled Access, Fire Pit, Fitness Center, Guest Parking, Hiking Trails, Meeting Room, Paddle Tennis","associationFee":450,"associationFeeFrequency":"Monthly","associationFeeIncludes":"Building & Grounds, Cable TV, Clubhouse","associationYN":true,"attachedGarageYN":true,"bathroomsOneQuarter":0,"bathroomsTotalDecimal":3,"bathroomsTotalInteger":3,"bathroomsTotalNotational":3,"bathsFull":3,"bathsHalf":0,"bathsThreeQuarter":0,"bathsTotal":3,"bedsTotal":4,"buildingAreaSource":"Assessor","buildingAreaTotal":2637,"carportSpaces":0,"city":"Palm Springs","coListAgentAOR":"Newport","coListAgentFirstName":"Jeff","coListAgentId":"20200702222157620321000000","coListAgentLastName":"Stokes","coListAgentMemberType":"REALTOR","coListAgentMlsId":"MRM-U40200","coListAgentName":"Jeff Stokes","coListAgentOriginatingSystemMlsId":"MRM-U40200","coListAgentUserType":"Member","coListAgentViewName":"Jeff Stokes","comingSoonTimestamp":"2025-05-07T05:46:22Z","communityFeatures":"Street Lighting, Sidewalks, Curbs, Pickle Ball Courts","constructionMaterials":"Stucco","cooling":"Air Conditioning, Ceiling Fan(s), Central Air, Dual, Gas","coolingYN":true,"country":"US","countyOrParish":"Riverside","crossStreet":"Four Seasons Blvd x Sunrise Way","currentPrice":729500,"currentPricePublic":729500,"displayCompliance":{"view":"Summary","iDXLogo":{"type":"Text","logoUri":"Equity Union"},"iDXLogoSmall":{"type":"Text","logoUri":"IDX"}},"documentsChangeTimestamp":"2025-05-07T05:46:22Z","documentsCount":0,"electric":"In Garage","entryLocation":"Foyer, Ground Level -
