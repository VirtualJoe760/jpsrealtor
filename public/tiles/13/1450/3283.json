This is a VERY rare and unique property! It is the ONLY 4 bedroom Monterey plan that includes a newly built custom 4 room detached casita that is legally permitted as an ADU (Accessory Dwelling Unit) completed in January 2023. The casita rents during the high season for $2,500 to $2,700 per month. Casita rooms include a home theater with both a 120'' motorized movie screen and a 65'' flat panel TV, a full kitchen (except dishwasher), laundry room, bedroom, and a bathroom with a walk-in shower. High-end finishes include an electronic digital shower with temperature read-out, a Whirlpool 5 burner stove with double ovens, refrigerator, porcelain plank flooring and  carpeting in the home theater. The home theater includes a Denon 5.1 surround sound system with a Ben-Q  projector and the 120'' screen. The casita bedroom includes a 60'' Smart TV, and a queen bed with a ''zero gravity'' adjustable base. Nearly $300,000 total spent in upgrades between the casita and the main home. The main house has 3 bedrooms and 2 baths. Upgrades include black-out curtains in the master and great room, large electric awning, shutters, roller shades, crown molding in all rooms, newer Milgard windows throughout, and a combination of luxury vinyl plank flooring, wood laminate and porcelain tile in every room. The newly remodeled kitchen has high end ''Champaign'' finished cabinetry including roll outs and soft close drawers and doors, glass backsplash, granite counters, upper cabinet rope lighting, under cabinet lighting, pantry back-lighting, a new gas cooktop, and a Samsung Smart Hub refrigerator with internet and an interior camera so you can see what you need when you go to the market. There are 10 ceiling fans total including 2 in the garage, both bedrooms, kitchen, great room, master bathroom, casita bedroom, casita bathroom and the patio. The great room includes a new 83'' Samsung 4K OLED TV with a Denon surround sound system, and a new fireplace and mantel with under-mantel rope lighting. The courtyard that separates the house from the casita has a soothing water fountain with a new concrete overlay deck. The back yard is spacious enough for a large pool/spa or water feature. Price includes all TV's, projector, motorized screen and 2 surround sound systems. Seller will pay the buyer's Reserve Replenishment Assessment fee of approximately $3,570.
