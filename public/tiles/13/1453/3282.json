This zoning allows for a variety of uses, including single-family residential, farming, animal raising, equestrian facilities, and certain conditional agricultural operations. R-A-20 supports low-density rural development while offering wide flexibility for agricultural and ranching operations.\r\n\r\nThe property is fully equipped for immediate use with nearly 600 mature date palms, 12 covered horse corrals, multiple irrigated pastures for livestock, and a large hay cover structure. A shared well, canal water, on-site reservoir, and electric power are already in place, ensuring strong infrastructure for both farming and livestock needs.\r\n\r\nA mobile home with septic system and electric service is positioned near the main working areaâ€”ideal for ranch management, staff housing, or a future ADU upgrade. The property is fully fenced and gated for large vehicles and equipment. Existing improvements make this farm turnkey for agricultural operators, horse boarding, or investment with income potential from crop production and ag leasing.\r\n\r\nLocated just seconds from Hwy 86, Jacqueline Cochran Airport, and the Thermal Club, this farm offers ease of access while preserving privacy and rural function. Ideal for owner-users, ag investors, or equestrian operators looking for water, infrastructure, and room to grow in the Coachella Valley.","resourceUri":"/v1/listings/20250430223146611505000000","seniorCommunityYN":false,"sewer":"Septic Tank","slug":"20250430223146611505000000","slugAddress":"88161-airport-boulevard-thermal-ca-92274","sourceSystemID":"M00000072","sourceSystemKey":"20250430223146611505000000","sourceSystemName":"Greater Palm Springs Multiple Listing Service","spaYN":false,"sparkModificationTimestamp":"2025-06-06T01:38:39Z","specialListingConditions":"Standard","standardStatus":"Active","stateOrProvince":"CA","statusChangeDate":"2025-04-30","statusChangeTimestamp":"2025-04-30T23:39:09Z","streetName":"Airport","streetNumber":"88161","streetNumberInteger":88161,"streetSuffix":"Boulevard","subdivisionName":"Not Applicable","totalBathroomsSource":"MLS","unparsedAddress":"88161 Airport Boulevard, Thermal, CA 92274","unparsedFirstLineAddress":"88161 Airport Boulevard","vOWAddressDisplayYN":true,"vOWAutomatedValuationDisplayYN":true,"vOWConsumerCommentYN":true,"vOWEntireListingDisplayYN":true,"videosCount":0,"viewYN":false,"virtualTourURLUnbranded":"https://youtu.be/bJoqgkqvwv4","virtualTours":[{"groupId":"20250512222555861986000000","currentPrivacy":"Public","privacy":"Public","resourceUri":"/v1/listings/20250430223146611505000000/virtualtours/20250512222555861986000000","id":"20250512222555861986000000","name":"Airport Blvd - Video","uri":"https://youtu.be/bJoqgkqvwv4","type":"unbranded","modificationTimestamp":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"}],"virtualToursCount":1,"waterSource":"Well, Other","cluster":false}}]
