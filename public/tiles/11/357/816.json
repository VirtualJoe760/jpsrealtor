The first cabins built in the canyon date back to 1895 when the canyon was U.S. Forest Service land. Today the Dogwood Blue Jay Canyon is home to 83 cabins on 160 acres. There are only two vacant lots in this private, gated community, and only this 1/3-acre, level lot sits on the natural, year-round creek. The house burned down about 20 years ago, and now it awaits your cabin dreams. A great location for those seeking inspiration, or simply an escape from the big city. Surround yourself with a forest of Dogwoods and Pines and walk the private trails that ramble through the community greenbelt. The HOA has their own water company with some of the most pristine water quality anywhere in the state.","resourceUri":"/v1/listings/20250514200547889187000000","roadFrontageType":"Private Road","schoolDistrict":"Rim of the World","seniorCommunityYN":false,"sewer":"Septic Tank","slug":"20250514200547889187000000","slugAddress":"710-blue-jay-canyon-road-lake-arrowhead-ca-92317","sourceSystemID":"M00000072","sourceSystemKey":"20250514200547889187000000","sourceSystemName":"Greater Palm Springs Multiple Listing Service","spaYN":false,"sparkModificationTimestamp":"2025-06-06T01:41:27Z","specialListingConditions":"Standard","standardStatus":"Active","stateOrProvince":"CA","statusChangeDate":"2025-05-14","statusChangeTimestamp":"2025-05-14T20:21:31Z","streetName":"Blue Jay Canyon","streetNumber":"710","streetNumberInteger":710,"streetSuffix":"Road","subdivisionName":"Not Applicable","totalBathroomsSource":"MLS","unparsedAddress":"710 Blue Jay Canyon Road, Lake Arrowhead, CA 92317","unparsedFirstLineAddress":"710 Blue Jay Canyon Road","utilities":"Electricity Available, Natural Gas Available","vOWAddressDisplayYN":true,"vOWAutomatedValuationDisplayYN":true,"vOWConsumerCommentYN":true,"vOWEntireListingDisplayYN":true,"videosChangeTimestamp":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","videosCount":1,"view":"Creek/Stream, Trees/Woods","viewYN":true,"virtualToursCount":0,"cluster":false}}]
