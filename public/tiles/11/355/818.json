The 4 bed/3 bath main residence features a red-tile roof, graceful arches, owned solar that slashes utility bills, and a shaded olive-citrus courtyard for alfresco dining. A 2017 renovation delivered a granite-island chef's kitchen with upgraded cabinetry and stainless accents, a dining-living core, luxury plank/tile floors, and spa-style baths with LED mirrors. At the rear, an approx. 2,000 sf auxiliary building pairs a full apartment (kitchen + bath) with a separate flex wing and second bathâ€”ideal for multigenerational living, rental, studio, gym, or office. Heavy-duty asphalt blankets most of the parcel, gating 20+ cars, fleets, boats, or a 40-ft coach, all served by an on-site RV dump with grinder. A covered carport plus roll-up workshop bays corral tools and toys. A-1 Light Ag lets you keep horses or hobby livestock, plant orchards, add barns or an ADU, and run farm-stands with minor permitsâ€”country freedom without giving up city convenience. No HOA, low taxes, sunset views, and fast-rising Inland Empire values make this versatile compound a future-proof investment.","resourceUri":"/v1/listings/20250529004024265972000000","roof":"Clay Tile","securityFeatures":"Other","seniorCommunityYN":false,"sewer":"In, Connected and Paid","slug":"20250529004024265972000000","slugAddress":"7858-sherry-lane-jurupa-valley-ca-92509","sourceSystemID":"M00000072","sourceSystemKey":"20250529004024265972000000","sourceSystemName":"Greater Palm Springs Multiple Listing Service","spaYN":false,"sparkModificationTimestamp":"2025-06-08T06:45:07Z","specialListingConditions":"Standard","standardStatus":"Active","stateOrProvince":"CA","statusChangeDate":"2025-05-30","statusChangeTimestamp":"2025-05-30T15:24:43Z","storiesTotal":1,"streetName":"Sherry","streetNumber":"7858","streetNumberInteger":7858,"streetSuffix":"Lane","subdivisionName":"Not Applicable","totalBathroomsSource":"Computed","unparsedAddress":"7858 Sherry Lane, Jurupa Valley, CA 92509","unparsedFirstLineAddress":"7858 Sherry Lane","vOWAddressDisplayYN":true,"vOWAutomatedValuationDisplayYN":true,"vOWConsumerCommentYN":true,"vOWEntireListingDisplayYN":true,"videosCount":0,"viewYN":false,"virtualToursCount":0,"walkScore":0,"windowFeatures":"Drapes","yearBuilt":1979,"yearBuiltSource":"Assessor","cluster":false}}]
