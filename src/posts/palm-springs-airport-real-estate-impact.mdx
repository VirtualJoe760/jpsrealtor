# 5 Ways the Palm Springs Airport Master Plan Impacts Coachella Valley Real Estate

The Coachella Valley is experiencing a wave of growth, and the recently approved Palm Springs International Airport (PSP) Master Plan is paving the way for even more expansion. With plans to accommodate international travel, expand terminals, and improve passenger convenience, the airport is not just transforming travelâ€”itâ€™s reshaping the region's real estate market. Here are five ways this major development is driving demand for homes and investments across the valley.

## 1. **The Gateway Effect: Attracting Buyers to the Coachella Valley**

In the past decade, tens of thousands of new residents have made the Coachella Valley their home, with full-time population numbers nearing **500,000 residents**. The PSP expansion, including enhanced international travel capabilities, is designed to meet this growing demand. By improving accessibility for buyers and investors, the airport serves as a gateway, drawing people to the area and boosting interest in local real estate.

## 2. **A Magnet for Global Investment**

With the Valleyâ€™s seasonal population swelling to over **600,000 during peak months**, the airportâ€™s new international capabilities position it to attract buyers from around the globe. Investors seeking luxury homes, vacation properties, and development opportunities are increasingly looking to the Coachella Valley as a premier destination. The airportâ€™s upgrades make it easier than ever for international buyers to discover and invest in the area.

## 3. **A Draw for International and Out-of-State Buyers**

The Coachella Valley has welcomed an estimated **50,000 new residents in the past five years**, thanks to its warm climate, lifestyle appeal, and growing opportunities. With the PSP expansion making it easier for out-of-state and international buyers to travel here, demand for homes in cities like Palm Springs, Rancho Mirage, and La Quinta is expected to surge. These buyers, many of whom are retirees, remote workers, or second-home seekers, will add new momentum to the housing market.

## 4. **Boost to Local Business and Economic Growth**

The Valleyâ€™s growth is fueled not just by new residents, but also by its thriving business sector. Cities like Desert Hot Springs have seen significant population increases, adding **over 8,000 residents in the past decade alone**, and post-pandemic trends have accelerated this growth. The PSP expansion aligns with this trajectory, supporting business development and bringing new workers to the region, which directly fuels demand for residential housing.

## 5. **Real Estate on the Radar: The Global Spotlight on Palm Springs**

The Coachella Valley is rapidly becoming a globally recognized destination for luxury living. With a population nearing **500,000 full-time residents** and projections of significant growth in the next 10-20 years, the PSP expansion ensures the region remains accessible to both short-term visitors and long-term residents. As the Valley garners more international attention, demand for homes across all price points is set to increase, providing new opportunities for buyers, sellers, and investors alike.
