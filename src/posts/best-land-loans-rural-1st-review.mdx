As a real estate agent, I work with a lot of clients who want to buy land and eventually build their dream home — but financing land isn’t always easy. Most banks require **40% down**, offer **high interest rates**, and stick you with **short loan terms** that don’t match your construction timeline.

That’s why I’m excited to share my new go-to land lender: **Rural 1st®**.

This is one of the best lot loan programs I’ve ever come across, and it's tailor-made for people buying land now and planning to build later. Whether you're eyeing a desert parcel, rural acreage, or a future homesite — **this program makes it possible without overextending**.

### Why Rural 1st Is My Preferred Lot Loan Lender

#### ✅ Fixed Rates on Bare Land  
Many lenders only offer variable rates for raw land — not Rural 1st. They give you **fully fixed-rate options**, so you can lock in now and not worry about market swings.

#### ✅ Lower Down Payments  
Forget 30–40% down. Rural 1st’s program allows for **far more manageable down payments**, making land ownership accessible.

#### ✅ Roll Your Lot Loan Into a Construction Loan  
When you're ready to build, your land equity counts. You can **roll your existing lot loan into a construction loan**, and they’ll credit your land, outbuildings, and improvements toward the new loan — potentially reducing your cash requirement even further.

#### ✅ Easy Rate Reduction  
If rates drop after you lock in, you don’t have to refinance. A simple call and small fee lets you **reduce your rate hassle-free**.

#### ✅ Full-Service from Start to Finish  
They don’t sell your loan or pass you off to a call center. Rural 1st services your loan from day one to the very end — including when you're ready to build.
