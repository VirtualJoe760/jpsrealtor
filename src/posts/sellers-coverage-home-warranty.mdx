Selling a home can be unpredictable — and expensive — especially if something breaks down mid-listing. One of the smartest tools sellers can use to stay ahead of potential problems is **Seller’s Coverage**, a home warranty plan designed specifically for listings. 

Let’s break down what it is, how it works, and why it might help your home sell faster and more confidently.

### What Is Seller’s Coverage?

**Seller’s Coverage** is a temporary home warranty plan available during the listing period — typically up to 180 days or until the home closes escrow. It’s only available when a buyer’s home warranty is also purchased and is designed to protect homeowners from the financial burden of major repair issues that can arise while the home is on the market.

It applies to:
- Single-family homes
- Condos, townhomes, and mobile homes under 5,000 sq. ft.

Once issued, coverage begins immediately and continues until the home sells, the listing is withdrawn, or the 180-day period ends — whichever comes first.

### What Does Seller’s Coverage Include?

Seller’s Coverage can step in to repair or replace many of the **most common systems and appliances** that buyers often inspect closely, including:

- Plumbing system and stoppages
- Electrical system
- Heating and accessible ductwork (up to $1,500 combined max)
- Water heater
- Garbage disposal and recirculating hot water pump
- Dishwasher, range, oven, built-in microwave
- Garage door opener
- Ceiling and attic fans
- Smoke and carbon monoxide detectors
- Pest control and more

Optional air conditioning coverage is available as an add-on (subject to a $1,500 aggregate limit), and coverage amounts vary for certain components like ductwork or cracked heat exchangers.

This protection means if something fails during showings or while you’re under contract, you’re not stuck footing the full repair bill or delaying the sale to fix it.

### How It Helps Homes Sell Faster

1. **Prevents Deal-Killing Delays**  
   If a water heater bursts or the A/C stops working while your home is listed, it can derail buyer interest or stall escrow. Seller’s Coverage allows quick fixes, helping you stay on schedule.

2. **Boosts Buyer Confidence**  
   When buyers know a home was protected by warranty during the listing period, they often feel more secure about the home’s condition and upkeep.

3. **Reduces Out-of-Pocket Surprises**  
   Instead of scrambling to pay for unexpected repairs, many covered issues will be handled through the warranty — minimizing financial stress.

4. **Signals a Maintained Property**  
   Homes with Seller’s Coverage show that the seller took proactive steps to care for their home, which can be a compelling selling point during negotiations.
