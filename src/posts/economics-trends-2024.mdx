## **1. Global Inflation Trends: Easing but Still Impactful**

After a period of high inflation, 2024 is expected to bring some stabilization as central banks maintain a cautious stance. Key points to consider:  

- **Moderate Easing:** Inflation is predicted to decrease globally as supply chains normalize. However, core inflation remains above pre-pandemic levels in many regions.  
- **Sector-Specific Impacts:** Industries such as energy and food may still see price volatility, affecting consumer spending and saving behaviors.  
- **Interest Rate Adjustments:** Central banks may shift to smaller rate hikes or pauses, balancing inflation control with economic growth.  

For prospective homeowners, this could mean slightly more favorable mortgage rates compared to the highs of recent years, making 2024 a potentially opportune time to buy.
