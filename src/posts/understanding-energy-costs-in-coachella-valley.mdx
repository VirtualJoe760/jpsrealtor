## ⚡ Why IID Is Cheaper Than SCE

If you're buying a home in the Coachella Valley, one of the most overlooked—yet impactful—factors is **your electricity provider**. Most homes in the valley are serviced by either the **Imperial Irrigation District (IID)** or **Southern California Edison (SCE)**, and the difference in rates can be significant.

- **IID residential base rate**: ~19.8¢ per kWh  
- **SCE residential rate**: ~30–35¢ per kWh  
- **IID homes pay ~39% less** on average

IID is a publicly owned utility district, and that ownership model has helped keep rate increases minimal—just 8% since 1994, compared to over 117% inflation in that same time period. Even with planned 2025 updates, IID remains one of the lowest-cost providers in California.

## 🗺️ Where IID Ends and SCE Begins

Which provider you get depends on where your property is located:

- **IID covers**: Most of *La Quinta*, *Indio*, *Coachella*, *Thermal*, and *Mecca*, plus parts of *Bermuda Dunes*.
- **SCE covers**: *Palm Springs*, *Palm Desert*, *Rancho Mirage*, *Cathedral City*, and *Desert Hot Springs*.

It’s a good idea to verify before purchasing. Ask your agent or check the utility meter on-site.

## ☀️ Solar + Net Billing in IID

IID doesn’t offer full net metering—but it does provide **net billing**:

- You **pay ~11.7¢/kWh** for what you pull from the grid
- You **earn ~6.8¢/kWh** for excess solar energy sent back

That still makes solar worthwhile. One homeowner reported trimming a **$376 summer bill to $168** after installing solar with battery backup—a **58% savings**.
