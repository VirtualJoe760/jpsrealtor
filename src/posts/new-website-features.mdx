# 🚧 Big Changes Are Coming to JPSRealtor.com

We’re working hard behind the scenes to bring some exciting new updates to the website, and I couldn’t wait to share what’s coming.

First, the **Listings section** is getting a full revamp! The new layout will be easier to use, cleaner to navigate, and built with a focus on helping you find the right home faster. Whether you're browsing on your phone or computer, the experience will be smoother and smarter.

Next, I’m developing **user sign-in functionality**—so you’ll soon be able to **create an account and save your favorite listings**. No more digging through old emails or scrolling endlessly to find that one great house again. Your own personalized dashboard is on the way.

But that’s not all…

I’m especially excited about a **brand-new feature** designed to make the home search process fun, visual, and interactive. I won’t spoil all the details yet—but think of it as a fresh, unique way to “find” new listings that match your lifestyle and vibe. You will not find this functionality on Zillow or Redfin, and will prefer it to those websites.

Thanks for being part of this journey with me. Your feedback and support mean the world, and I can’t wait to launch these new features ASAP. Stay tuned!
