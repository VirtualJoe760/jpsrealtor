## A Brief History of Modernism in Palm Springs

Palm Springs' connection to modernism began in the early 20th century when the desert landscape became a luxurious retreat for Hollywood’s elite. During the 1920s and 30s, stars like Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, and Marilyn Monroe sought refuge in the desert, commissioning private homes that combined luxury with functionality. Initially dominated by Spanish Colonial Revival architecture, the city’s design landscape would soon undergo a radical transformation.

Following World War II, Palm Springs became a hub for **mid-century modern architecture**, thanks to visionary architects like **Richard Neutra, Albert Frey, Donald Wexler, William Krisel**, and **E. Stewart Williams**. These designers embraced a new style, now known as **Desert Modernism**, characterized by sleek lines, open floor plans, floor-to-ceiling windows, and the seamless blending of indoor and outdoor spaces. Key features of this movement included **flat roofs, breeze blocks, and minimalist designs** that harmonized with the desert surroundings.

Iconic structures like the **Kaufmann Desert House**, **Frey House II**, and **Twin Palms Estate (Frank Sinatra’s home)** exemplify this style and have become architectural landmarks. The city’s neighborhoods, such as **Vista Las Palmas, Deepwell Estates**, and **Indian Canyons**, became showcases of mid-century design, attracting celebrities and tastemakers.

As the decades passed, many of these homes fell into disrepair, but the **1990s saw a resurgence in appreciation for mid-century architecture**. Organizations like the **Palm Springs Preservation Foundation** and **Modernism Week** were established to protect and celebrate these architectural gems. Preservation efforts have since transformed Palm Springs into a living museum of mid-century design.

Today, Modernism Week brings thousands of visitors from around the world to experience the legacy of this golden era through **tours, lectures, exhibitions, and social events**. The festival not only celebrates design but also promotes the ongoing preservation of Palm Springs' architectural heritage for future generations.
