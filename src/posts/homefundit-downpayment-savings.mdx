Buying a home just got a whole lot easier.

[HomeFundItÂ®](https://www.homefundit.com/realtor/jpsrealtor) is an online platform by CMG Financial that helps homebuyers â€” especially **first-time buyers** â€” crowdfund their down payment, earn bonus grants, and even collect credits by shopping online. Think of it being similar to goFundMe & Acorns. When you spend at selected shopping retailers, a small percentage of your purchases go towards your HomeFundIt account, while also being able to recruit friends and family.

If saving for a down payment feels overwhelming, HomeFundIt offers **three smart ways** to get into your home faster:

---

## 1. Collect Down Payment Gifts

Friends and family can gift up to **$5,000 each** directly through your campaign page â€” no taxes, fees, or paperwork required. Simply:

- Sign up and set your down payment goal
- Share your campaign link
- Receive instant gifts via debit or credit card

---

## 2. Shop to Save with UpIt

Get bonus funds just by shopping! Over **1,000 online retailers** participate in the program. When you or your supporters shop through your campaignâ€™s **UpIt link**, a percentage of every purchase is pledged toward your down payment.

- Earn on average **7.5% back per purchase**
- Participating retailers offer **1% to 50% back**
- Use the **UpIt Chrome Extension** to make it automatic

---

## 3. Earn Up to $2,000 in Closing Cost Grants

HomeFundIt will match your down payment gifts **$2 for every $1 raised**, up to the lesser of **$2,000 or 1%** of your homeâ€™s purchase price.

Even better? You can earn **extra bonus dollars** every time you or a supporter shares your campaign via Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter.

---

## Why HomeFundIt Works

Unlike traditional down payment assistance programs, HomeFundIt is **fast, digital, and shareable**. Whether you're getting help from family, earning back from online shopping, or taking advantage of grant matching, you're building momentum toward your dream home.

If you're ready to buy but saving feels like a roadblock â€” this platform might just be the jumpstart you need.
