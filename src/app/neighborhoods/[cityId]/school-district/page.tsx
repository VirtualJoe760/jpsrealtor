          The Coachella Valley is served by three primary school districts, each offering distinct boundaries
          and communities. The Palm Springs Unified School District (PSUSD) serves areas such as Palm Springs, Desert Hot Springs, and Cathedral City. Desert Sands Unified School District (DSUSD) covers regions like La Quinta, Indian Wells, and Palm Desert, known for its high-rated schools and suburban charm. Coachella Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) encompasses Coachella, Thermal, and Mecca, providing education across more rural parts of the valley. For buyers and families, understanding these districtsâ€™ boundaries is crucial, as proximity to quality schools can significantly influence your real estate goals.
